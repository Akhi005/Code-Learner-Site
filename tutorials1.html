        <h1>Chapter-01:Basic Python</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Definition:</h2>
    <div class="home1">
        <h3 >  Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.</h3>
    </div>
    
    <br>
    <h2> Why to Learn Python?</h2>
    <div class="home-box">
        <h3 > =>  Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</h3>
    
        <br>
        <h3 > =>  Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 > =>  Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
       <h2>Characteristics of Python</h2> 
    </div>
    <div class="home-box">
        <h3>=>  Following are important characteristics of Python Programming −</h3>
        <h3>=>  It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</h3>
        <h3>=>  It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</h3>
        <h3>=>  It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</h3>
        <h3>=>  It supports automatic garbage collection.</h3>
        <h3>=>  It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</h3>

    <h2>Hello World using Python.</h2>
    <div class="ju">
        <h3>print("Hello, World!")</h3>
    </div>
    <h2>The Python Command Line</h2>
    <div class="home-box">
        <h3>To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.</h3>
        <h3>Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:</h3>
        <div class="ju">
            <h3>C:\Users\Your Name>python</h3>
        </div>
        <h3>Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":</h3>
        <div class="ju">
            <h3>C:\Users\Your Name>py</h3>
        </div>
        <h3>From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:</h3>
        <div class="ju">
            <h3>>>>print("Hello, World!")</h3>
        </div>
        <h3>Which will write "Hello, World!" in the command line:</h3>
        <div class="fu">
            <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
        </div>
        <h3>Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:</h3>
        <div class="ju">
            <h3>exit()</h3>
        </div>
        <h2>Python Syntax</h2>
        <h3>As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</h3>
        <div class="fu">
            <h3>>>>print("Hello, World!")</h3>
            <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
        </div>
        <h3>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:</h3>
        <div class="ju">
            <h3>C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py</h3>
        </div>
        <h2>Python Indentation</h2>
        <h3>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</h3>
        <h3>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.</h3>
    
        <h3>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</h3>
        <h2>Example 1</h2>
         
         <div class="fu">
            <h3>if 5 > 2:</h3>
            <div class="mu">
                <h3>print("Five is greater than two!")</h3>
            </div>
            
        </div>
        <div class="ju">

        </div>
        
          
         
            <h3>Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</h3>
           <h2>Syntax Error:</h2>
           <div class="fu">
            <h3>if 5 > 2:</h3>
            <h3>print("Five is greater than two!")</h3>
            </div>

            </div>  
           <h3>The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.</h3> 
             
            <h2>Example 2</h2> 
            <div class="fu">
                <h3>if 5 > 2:</h3>
                <div class="mu">
                    <h3>print("Five is greater than two!")</h3>
                </div>
                <h3>if 5 > 2:</h3>
                <div class="pu">
                    <h3>print("Five is greater than two!")</h3>

                    <h3>You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:</h3>
                    <h2>Syntax Error:</h2>
                    <div class="fu">
                        <h3>if 5 > 2:</h3>

                        </div>
                    </div>    
               </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Python Variables</h2>
    <div class="home1">
        <h3>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:</h3>
    </div>
    <h2>Example 3:Variables in Python:</h2>
    <div class="home1">
        <div class="fu">
            <h3>x = 5</h3>
            <h3>y = "Hello, World!"</h3>   
        </div>
        
    
    <div class="ju">
        <h3><a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler"> Try yourself in Code Editor</a></h3>
    </div>  
    <h3>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</h3>
    <h3>You will learn more about variables in the Python Variables chapter.</h3>
    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <h3>Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.</h3>
    <h3>Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:</h3>
    <h2>Example 4:Comments in Python:</h2>
    <div class="fu">
        <h3>#This is a comment.</h3>
        <h3>print("Hello, World!")</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ju">
